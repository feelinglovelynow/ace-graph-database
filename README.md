## üôè Our Mission
* Create, maintain and enhance the Best database for JavaScript Developers!


## üîê Security
1. Ace formats data in [Cloudflare's](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) encrypted key value store as nodes, relationships and props (aka: a graph format)
1. Read, insert, update and delete permissions can be configured for nodes, relationships or props thanks to our `core` plugin

## ü•π Dynamic
1. Nodes may have props, relationships may have props, and relationships may be one to one, one to many or many to many
1. Our cli can save unencrypted backups locally, save encrypted backups locally and apply any of these backups to your graph for free

## üôå Types
1. Based on the JSON Schema you provide, our cli creates types for TypeScript devs and JSDoc comments for JavaScript devs
1. The Ace query language is a typesafe function called `ace()`, that enables expressive queries and transactional mutations

## üé¨ Create a Movie Graph 
****Step 1: Bash****
``` bash
pnpm add @ace/db # or npm
ace dev # start local graph
```
****Step 2: JavaScript: One transactional function call to `ace()`****
```ts
import { ace } from '@ace/db'


const response = await ace({
  host: 'http://localhost:8787',
  request: [ // The provided request array order, is the order Ace follows


    // Empty the graph, aka start fresh
    { id: 'Empty' },


    // Add the Actor node, the Movie node and the actsInMovie relationship to the schema
    {
      id: 'SchemaAdd',
      x: { // Intellisense within x changes based on above id
        schema: {
          nodes: {
            Actor: { // Node: Actor

****Step 3: Bash****
``` bash

```


## üßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è CLI
* Clone this repo or pull `@ace/db` from npm to get access to our cli
* To show everything our cli can do, asking our cli for help... is helpful ü•Å
* To do this, in bash just enter, `ace`, `ace -h`, `ace --help` or `ace help` and this is what shows up:
```bash
Ace Graph Database CLI v${ version }



ace
  Shows this message
  Options:
    -h      |  Optional  |  ace -h
    help    |  Optional  |  ace help
    --help  |  Optional  |  ace --help



ace version
   Prints your currently downloaded Ace Graph Database Version



ace jwks
  Creates 1 public jwk and 1 private jwk (that may be used together) and logs the jwks to the console
  Why: Send jwks to ace() whenever you would love to do cryptography
  JWKs:
    - JSON Web Keys
    - Cryptography keys
    - Like a password
      - A private jwk can encrypt and decrypt data
      - A private jwk can create a hash while a public jwk can validate a hash
      - We recomend storing jwks in your .env file

## üï∞Ô∏è Origin Story
1. Java SQL Strings
1. PHP SQL Strings
1. Node SQL Strings
1. Mongoose
1. Dgraph
1. Prisma
1. Drizzle
1. Cloudflare Durable Objects
1. Ace


## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Why was Ace created?
1. Graph = Natural Data Storage
    * Nodes = Neurons
    * Relationships = Synapses
1. Example:
    * To remember Mom's Yoga Studio, I do not join All Users and All Yoga Studio's in my mind
    * Instead I just walk the graph, from one node to the next, just like Ace
1. So graphs resemble how we naturally store data but before Ace, no graph database offered lovely intellisense like Prisma or Drizzle
    * So this is the hole in the market we fill
    * Ace unites a Graph Database with JavaScript Intellisense!


## ‚ö°Ô∏è Performance
* Goodbye joins and greetings `maps`, aka node and relationship queries are [O(1)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/697918/what-does-o1-access-time-mean)
    * For example, If a users uid is `abc` and you'd love to get all that users friends, Ace will:
        1. `O(1)` lookup the users node `map.get('abc')`
        1. Find the the index of friend uids in the value for that node, `friends: [ 'xyz', '123' ]`
        1. `O(1)` lookup each friend `map.get([ 'xyz', '123' ])` from [Cloudflare's](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) key value store (aka: a Map)
    * JavaScript is not the fastest language, but for something this simple, (`map.put()` & `map.get()`), it‚Äôs a lovely v1 language
    * By [v3](#-version-3-roadmap) we plan on providing Universal (Self) Hosting and Ace Cloud Hosting options thanks to a low level language rewrite (maybe w/ [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) 1.x) that'll compile to a binary and can be hosted anywhere! üòÄ


## üìÄ Storage Options
1. Cloudflare Durable Object
    * Version 1
    * Their $5 a month pricing tier allows:
        * [50 GB of Storage](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/platform/limits/)
        * [1 million monthly requests](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/platform/pricing/)
        * [Encryption @ Rest](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/reference/data-security/)
1. Universal (Self) Hosting
    * Version 3
1. Ace Cloud Hosting
    * Version 3


## ü§ì Version 1 Roadmap
1. Validations
    * Schema
        * Node and Prop name must not have a space in them
    * ace()
        * A prop of `$ace` is not allowed
1. Cloudflare allows a `storage.get()` of up to [128](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/api/transactional-storage-api/#get) keys at a time 
    * Create `./src/lib/ace/storage/get()`
    * If key count is > 120 => do the `storage.get()` in batches of 120 then concat the results
1. $o
    * `random`
    * `newProps` (support based on response)
1. `ace()`
    * Response Types
    * Sanitize / Validate Input 
    * Graphs support 
    * Complete idsAce
1. Relationship prop indexes
    * Sort Index
    * Unique Index
1. Full Text Index
    * Node Prop
    * Relationship Prop
1. Schema default values
    * If value is `now` and dataType is `isoString` rather then default to string now, default to the current timestamp
1. Runtime validation
    * v1
      * Accepts: a test object + (a schema node / a schema relationship) 
      * Responds: does the test object obey the schema
    * v2
      * Also accepts options to add validations, edit validations or remove validations
1. Comments (param, returns, description, example usage, why, proofread) for all index functions
1. Create a GDPR Compliant Ecommerce Store w/ Ace
    * Real project (example / benchmarks)
    * Ecomm store w/ EU Customer Data Stored in an EU Durable Object
1. App Worker > Ace Durable Object
1. Schema Migrations
    * Every schema node relationship and prop has a uid
        * This way when we are compaing schemas we can know how the schema has been updated
    * `ace migrationToFile`
        * recieve devSchema & mainSchema
        * Create a plugin, install gets us from one schema to the next, uninstall gets us from prod schema to dev schema
        * Save plugin to the ace/migrations
        * Optional options
            * File Name (Default now timestamp)
            * JWK (To Encrypt the plugin)
    * `ace applyMigration`
        * Run migration plugin install @ host
    * `ace revertMigration`
        * Run migration plugin uninstall @ host
1. 2FA + Authy Support

## üåé Call `ace()` with cURL
* The Ace query language with cURL, is the same as above in `JS/TS`
* Thanks to `ace types`, above is easier, thanks to intellisense
* To format the JSON response, `npm i -g json` and then @ the end of a cURL add ` | json`
``` bash
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{
    "request": [
      { "id": "NodeInsert", "node": "Movie",  "x": { "name": "Hercules" } },
      { "id": "NodeQuery",  "node": "Movie", "prop": "movies" },
      { "id": "RelationshipQuery",  "relationship": "actsInMovie", "prop": "actsInMovie" },
    ]
  }' \
