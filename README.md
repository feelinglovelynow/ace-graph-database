# üïâ Ace Graph Database


## üôè JavaScipt's BEST Database!
* Our mission is to create, maintain and enhance the Best database for JavaScript Developers!


## ü§î What is Ace?
1. Ace structures data in encrypted key value stores as a graph (nodes, relationships and properties)
1. Nodes may have props, relationships may have props, and relationships may be one to one, one to many or many to many
1. Our cli scipt `ace types` creates TypeScript types (TS) and JSDoc comments (JS), based on the JSON Schema you provide


## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Queries, Mutations and Data Management
1. The Ace query language is a typesafe (JS/TS) function called `ace()`, that provides expressive queries and transactional mutations
1. Roles and permissions by node, relationship or property, for the actions read, insert, update, upsert, or delete can be easily configured thanks to our `core` plugin
1. Our cli scipt provides functionality to save zipped and encrypted backups locally for free or to Cloudflare R2... and applying backups to a graph is simple with our cli too


## üé¨ Create a Movie Graph 
****Step 1: Bash****
``` bash
pnpm add @feelinglovelynow/ace-graph-database # or npm
ace dev # start local graph
```
****Step 2: JavaScript (The 1 transactional function call to `ace()` below will)****
1. Add nodes `Actor` and `Movie` and relationship `actsInMovie` to schema via `AddToSchema`
1. Add `The Matrix` and `Avatar` nodes to the graph via `AddNodeToGraph`
1. Add `Keanu`, `Laurence` and `Carrie` nodes to the graph and add their relationships to the `Matrix` to the graph, by placing enums after `_:` (relationship additions can also be done w/ uids) via `AddRelationshipToGraph`
1. Place a backup into the response @ `response.backup` via `GetBackup`
1. Place the schema into the response @ `response.schema` via `GetSchema`
1. Place 3 queries into the response @ `response.actors`, `response.actsInMovie` and `response.matrix` via `QueryByNode` and `QueryByRelationship`
```ts
const response = await ace({
  host: 'http://localhost:8787',
  request: [
    {
      id: 'AddToSchema', // add the Actor node, the Movie node and the actsInMovie relationship to the schema
      x: { // intellisense below changes based on id above
        schema: {
          nodes: {
            Actor: {
              firstName: { id: 'Prop', x: { dataType: 'string', mustBeDefined: true } },
              lastName: { id: 'Prop', x: { dataType: 'string', mustBeDefined: true } },
              actsIn: { id: 'ForwardRelationshipProp', x: { has: 'many', node: 'Movie', relationship: 'actsInMovie' } },
            },
            Movie: {
              name: { id: 'Prop', x: { dataType: 'string', mustBeDefined: true } },
              actors: { id: 'ReverseRelationshipProp', x: { has: 'many', node: 'Actor', relationship: 'actsInMovie' } },
            },
          },
          relationships: {
            actsInMovie: {
              id: 'ManyToMany',
              x: {
                props: {
                  _salary: { id: 'RelationshipProp', x: { dataType: 'number' } } // This is a relationship prop (actsInMovie > _salary). When calling ace() with QueryByNode or QueryByRelationship, it is helpful for relationship props to start with an underscore. Starting relationship props with an underscore helps identify which props are node props (no underscores at start) and which props are relationship props (starts with underscore)
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },

    // uids generated by Ace here, uids are used in relationships below, thanks to enums placed after _:
    { id: 'AddNodeToGraph', node: 'Movie', x: { uid: '_:Matrix', name: 'The Matrix' } },
    { id: 'AddNodeToGraph', node: 'Actor', x: { uid: '_:Keanu', firstName: 'Keanu', lastName: 'Reeves' } },
    { id: 'AddNodeToGraph', node: 'Actor', x: { uid: '_:Laurence', firstName: 'Laurence', lastName: 'Fishburne' } },
    { id: 'AddNodeToGraph', node: 'Actor', x: { uid: '_:Carrie', firstName: 'Carrie-Anne', lastName: 'Moss' } },

    // a is the actor b/c schema.nodes.Actor has the ForwardRelationshipProp (Actor.actsIn)
    // b is the movie b/c schema.nodes.Movie has the ReverseRelationshipProp (Movie.actors)
    { id: 'AddRelationshipToGraph', relationship: 'actsInMovie', x: { a: '_:Keanu', b: '_:Matrix', _salary: 9001 } },
    { id: 'AddRelationshipToGraph', relationship: 'actsInMovie', x: { a: '_:Carrie', b: '_:Matrix', _salary: 420 } },
    { id: 'AddRelationshipToGraph', relationship: 'actsInMovie', x: { a: '_:Laurence', b: '_:Matrix', _salary: 369 } },

    // IF a uid is not specified for AddNodeToGraph as seen below THEN Ace creates one before placing the node into storage AND this node can't be used in relationships for this ace() call like we do above
    // IF a uid is set (crypto.randomUUID()) THEN Ace won't create a uid before placing the node into storage AND this node can be used in relationships for this ace() call by using the uid in relationships
    { id: 'AddNodeToGraph', node: 'Movie', x: { name: 'Avatar' } },

    // put a backup of the graph @ response.backup
    { id: 'GetBackup', prop: 'backup' },

    // put the current graph schema @ response.schema
    { id: 'GetSchema', prop: 'schema' },


    // QueryByNode - example: { matrix: { uid: 'abc', name: 'The Matrix', actors: [ ... ] } }

        $o: {
          findByUid: '_:Matrix' // option: response.matrix will only have the matrix object b/c this option is set, without this find, an array of all movies would be in the response
        },
        uid: true, // put uid into the response @ response.matrix.uid
        name: true,
        actors: {
          $o: {
            filter: [ { prop: 'salary' }, '>=', { avg: 'salary' } ], // respond with actors that have a salary greater than the average salary
            sort: { prop: 'salary', how: 'dsc' }, // sort actors by salary
            limit: { count: 2, skip: 1 }, // skip the first actor then show the next 2
            flow: [ 'filter', 'sort', 'limit', 'newProps' ], // do options in this order
            newProps: { // add these props to each actor
              bonus: [ 0.7 '*' [ { prop: 'salary' }, '/', 12 ] ], // [] items in newProps is like () items in math
              fullName: [ { prop: 'firstName' }, '+', ' ', '+', { prop: 'lastName' } ],
            },
          },

****Step 3: Bash****
``` bash
ace types -h=http://localhost:8787 #generate types that align with the above schema for intellisense
```


## ‚ö°Ô∏è CLI
* Clone this repo or pull `@feelinglovelynow/ace-graph-database` from npm to get access to our cli
* To show everything our cli can do, asking our cli for help... is helpful ü•Å
* To do this, in bash just enter, `ace`, `ace -h`, `ace --help` or `ace help` and this is what shows up:
```bash
Ace Graph Database CLI v${ version }



ace
  Shows this message
  Options:
    -h      |  Optional  |  ace -h
    help    |  Optional  |  ace help
    --help  |  Optional  |  ace --help



ace version
   Prints your currently downloaded Ace Graph Database Version



ace jwks
  Creates 1 public jwk and 1 private jwk (that may be used together) and logs the jwks to the console
  Why: Send jwks to ace() whenever you would love to do cryptography
  JWKs:
    - JSON Web Keys
    - Cryptography keys
    - Like a password
      - A private jwk can encrypt and decrypt data
      - A private jwk can create a hash while a public jwk can validate a hash
      - We recomend storing jwks in your .env file



ace dev
  Start a local Ace Graph Database (Cloudflare Worker + Cloudflare Durable Object)



ace types
  Create types (TS) and typedefs (JSDoc)
    - IF a host (Cloudflare Worker URL) is provided
      - Types take into consideration your schema by requesting it via the host
    - ELSE IF a (schema) file is provided [ Current Directory ]/ace/schemas/
      - Types take into consideration your schema by loading it locally from 
    - ELSE
      - Types do not take into consideration your schema
  Options:
    -h      |  Host  |  Optional  |  String
    --host  |  Host  |  Optional  |  String
    -f      |  File  |  Optional  |  String
    --file  |  File  |  Optional  |  String

    ace types -f=qa.json
    ace types --file=2024-03-24T19:44:36.492Z.json



ace schemaToFile
  Get most recent schema from graph and then save schema to a file locally
  Location File: [ Current Directory ]/ace/schemas/[ File Name ].json
  File Name Default: Now Iso Datetime
  Options:
    -h      |  Host       |  Required  |  String

    ace schemaToFile --host=http://localhost:8787
    ace schemaToFile -h=http://localhost:8787 -n=qa
    ace schemaToFile --host=http://localhost:8787 --name=dev



ace graphToFile
  Generate backup and then save backup to a file locally
  Location File: [ Current Directory ]/ace/backups/[ File Name ].json
  File Name Default: Now Iso Datetime
  Options:
    -h      |  Host       |  Required  |  String
    --host  |  Host       |  Required  |  String
    -n      |  File Name  |  Optional  |  String

    ace graphToFile --host=http://localhost:8787
    ace graphToFile -h=http://localhost:8787 -n=qa
    ace graphToFile --host=http://localhost:8787 --name=dev



ace fileToGraph
  Read backup from file and then save backup to graph
  File Location: [ Current Directory ]/ace/backups/[ File ]
  Skip Data Delete: When a backup is applied with "ace fileToGraph" an entire graph delete is done first, to avoid the delete and just apply the backup use this option
  Options:
    -f                |  File              |  Required  |  String
    -file             |  File              |  Required  |  String

* A noun stored in a graph, has a name like `Movie`
* If storing a node it must align with a node name in your schema, defined in schema @ `const schema = { nodes }`
* Nodes may have properties
### Relationship
* Explains how two nodes unite, has a name like `actsInMovie`
* If storing a relationship it must align with a relationship name in your schema, defined in schema @ `const schema = { relationships }`
* Each relationship also comes with Node Properties that shows the relationship in both directions
    * One `ForwardRelationshipProp` may be combined with one `ReverseRelationshipProp` or one `BidirectionalRelationshipProp` may be used
* Relationships may have properties
### Properties
* Information about one node (eg: `Movie` node, `name` prop) or one relationship (`actsInMovie` relationship, `_salary` prop)
* Relationship properties start with an underscore to help differentiate node props and relationship props during `ace()` queries
### Property Data Types
* string
* number
* boolean
* hash
    1. Get public and private jwks from Ace by calling `ace()`, calling `createJWKs()` or with our cli `ace jwks`
    1. On a property that is the `hash` data type, do an `ace()` insert, and also send to `ace()` a private jwk
    1. Ace will hash the string and store the hash value in your graph
    1. When performing `ace()` queries, provide a public jwk to `Find` a node only if it matches a stored hash
* isoString
    * `(new Date()).toISOString()`
    * When doing a node or relationship mutation, provide a value of `'now'` to tell Ace to add the `isoString` now date as the value, example:
        * `{ id: 'AddNodeToGraph', node: 'Movie', props: { name: 'The Matrix', createdAt: 'now' } }`
### Schema
* Defines how your graph is structured, by defining the nodes, relationships and properties
* Is stored in your graph, at the key `$schema` to ease migrations
* Thanks to `ace schemaToFile`, your schema may also be easilly stored in a file in a JSON file, in your backend source control, like `Prisma`
### `ace()`
* Takes 1 parameter, an options object and this options object is the `Ace Query Language` or the `Ace Options`
* Supports / Default:
    * Responds with requested nodes, relationships and properties, similair to GraphQL but rather then string template queries and mutations, Typesafe intellisense via JSDoc Typedefs (comments) (not in build) and TypeScript types (not in build) (but super helpful during development)
    * To limit round trips, multiple sequential queries may be performed in the array request order
* Typically ORMs unite your databse with JavaScript, but now 1 function supports this!
* May also be called via HTTP at `[ host ]/ace`

## üåé Call `ace()` with cURL
* The Ace query language with cURL, is the same as above in `JS/TS`
* Thanks to `ace types`, above is easier, thanks to intellisense
* To format the JSON response, `npm i -g json` and then @ the end of a cURL add ` | json`
